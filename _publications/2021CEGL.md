excerpt: 'Recently, Brighton gave another cut-admissibility proof 
for the standard set-based sequent calculus GLS for modal provability logic GL. 
One of the two induction measures that Brighton uses is novel: the maximum 
height of regress trees in an auxiliary calculus called RGL. Tautology elimination 
is established rather than direct cut-admissibility, and at some points the input 
derivation appears to be ignored in favour of a derivation obtained by backward proof-search. 
By formalising the GLS calculus and the proofs in Coq, we show that: 
(1) the use of the novel measure is problematic under the usual interpretation of the 
Gentzen comma as set union, and a multiset-based sequent calculus provides a more natural formulation; 
(2) the detour through tautology elimination is unnecessary; and (3) we can use the same induction 
argument without regress trees to obtain a direct proof of cut-admissibility that is faithful to the input derivation.'
