excerpt: 'We design and study various topological semantics for the diamond-free 
intuitionistic modal logic iS4⁠, an intuitionistic analogue of S4⁠. 
Ultimately we prove that ordinary topological spaces can be 
used as semantics, using the specialization order to interpret intuitionistic 
implication and the interior for the modality. Some of our soundness and 
completeness results are mechanised in Coq.'
