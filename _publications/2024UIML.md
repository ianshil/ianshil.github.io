excerpt: 'The uniform interpolation property in a given logic can be understood as the 
definability of propositional quantifiers. We mechanise the computation of these 
quantifiers and prove correctness in the Coq proof assistant for three modal logics, 
namely: (1) the modal logic K, for which a pen-and-paper proof exists; (2) Godel-Lob logic GL, 
for which our formalisation clarifies an important point in an existing, but incomplete, 
sequent-style proof; and (3) intuitionistic strong Lob logic iSL, for which this is the first 
proof-theoretic construction of uniform interpolants. Our work also yields verified programs 
that allow one to compute the propositional quantifiers on any formula in this logic.'
