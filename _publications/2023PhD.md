excerpt: 'We contribute to the shift towards logic as a fully formalised science by formalising in
the interactive theorem prover Coq both new and known results. Our contribution is
threefold.

First, we define pen-and-paper general notions required in our dissertation: propo-
sitional and first-order syntax, axiomatic calculus, sequent calculus, Kripke semantics,
soundness and completeness results. Furthermore, we instantiate these notions in modal
logic, both in pen-and-paper and in Coq. Consequently, we constitute a readily available
and usable Coq library containing foundational elements of the study of modal logic, which
can thus serve as a basis for the formalisation of further works in non-classical logics.

Second, we exhibit and rectify a mistake that has gone unnoticed for almost fifty
years in the foundations of propositional and first-order bi-intuitionistic logic. We show
that both in the propositional and first-order case, what was conceived of as a unique
bi-intuitionistic logic is in fact two distinct logics. We trace these confusions back to
a fundamental problem in the axiomatic proof theory of propositional and first-order
bi-intuitionistic logic: traditional Hilbert calculi are not designed to treat logics as conse-
quence relations. They lead to an ambiguous notion of deduction from assumptions that
can cause us to conflate distinct rules and thus distinct logics. More precisely, we show
that the bi-intuitionistic rule (DN) is ambiguous in a traditional context and splits into two
distinct rules in the context of generalized Hilbert calculi. As a consequence, we obtain two
generalized Hilbert calculi in the propositional (wBIH and sBIH) and first-order (FOwBIH
and FOsBIH) case, for bi-intuitionistic logic that diﬀer only in the disambiguated version
of the (DN) rule they incorporate. Unsurprisingly, these systems capture two distinct
propositional logics (wBIL and sBIL) and first-order logics (FOwBIL and FOsBIL), which
have been conflated in the literature.

Third, we obtain cut-elimination results for the sequent calculi GLS and GL4ip, which
are sequent calculi for, respectively, the classical modal provability logic GLL and the in-
tuitionistic modal provability logic iGLL. These results involve a novel proof technique
for the admissibility of additive-cut called the “mhd proof technique”, which relies on the
fact that terminating backward proof-search allows us to attribute a “maximal height of
derivations” to each sequent. So, for each of the calculi GLS and GL4ip, we define a back-
ward proof-search procedure for it and develop a thorough termination argument using a
local measure on sequents and a well-founded relations along which this measure decreases
upwards in the proof-search. Then, we directly prove the admissibility of additive-cut for
both calculi using the mhd proof technique. We use this number, the mhd of a sequent, as
an induction measure in arguments involving local and syntactic transformations, allowing
us to exhibit and hence extract from our Coq formalisation Haskell programs constituting
cut-elimination procedures.'
