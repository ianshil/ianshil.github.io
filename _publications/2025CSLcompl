excerpt: 'We provide a succinct and verified completeness proof for first-order bi-intuitionistic 
logic, relative to constant domain Kripke semantics. By doing so, we make up for the almost-50-year-old 
substantial mistakes in Rauszer’s foundational work, detected but unresolved by Shillito two years ago. 
Moreover, an even earlier but historically neglected proof by Klemke has been found to contain at 
least local errors by Olkhovikov and Badia, that remained unfixed due to the technical complexity 
of Klemke’s argument. To resolve this unclear situation once and for all, we give a succinct 
completeness proof, based on and dualising a standard proof for constant domain intuitionistic 
logic, and verify our constructions using the Coq proof assistant to guarantee correctness.'
