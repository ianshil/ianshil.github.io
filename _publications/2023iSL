permalink: /publication/2023iSL
excerpt: 'We provide a new sequent calculus that enjoys syntactic cut-elimination and 
strongly terminating backward proof search for the intuitionistic Strong Löb logic, an 
intuitionistic modal logic with a provability interpretation. A novel measure on 
sequents is used to prove both the termination of the naive backward proof search strategy, 
and the admissibility of cut in a syntactic and direct way, leading to a straightforward 
cut-elimination procedure. All proofs have been formalised in the interactive theorem prover Coq.'
