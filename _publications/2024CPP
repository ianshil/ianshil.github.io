excerpt: 'Using the Coq proof assistant, we investigate the minimal non-constructive 
principles needed to show soundness and completeness of propositional bi-intuitionistic 
logic. Before being revisited and corrected by Gor√© and Shillito, the completeness of 
bi-intuitionistic logic, an extension of intuitionistic logic with a dual operation to 
implication, had a rather erratic history, making it an ideal case for computer mechanisation. 
Moreover, contributing a constructive perspective, we observe that the completeness of 
bi-intuitionistic logic explicates the same characteristics already observed in an 
ongoing effort to analyse completeness theorems in general.'
