excerpt: 'As anyone who reads the literature on bi-intuitionistic logic will know, the numerous
papers by Cecylia Rauszer are foundational but confusing. For example: these papers
claim and retract various versions of the deduction theorem for bi-intuitionistic logic;
they erroneously claim that the calculus is complete with respect to rooted canonical
models; and they erroneously claim the admissibility of cut in her sequent calculus for
this logic. Worse, authors such as Crolard, have based some of their own foundational
work on these confused and confusing results and proofs.
We trace this confusion to the axiomatic formalism of RBiInt in which Rauszer first
characterized bi-intuitionistic logic and show that, as in modal logic, RBiInt can be
interpreted as two diﬀerent consequence relations. We remove this ambiguity by using
generalized Hilbert calculi, which are tailored to capture consequence relations.
We show that RBiInt leads to two logics, wBIL and sBIL, with diﬀerent extensional
and meta-level properties, and that they are, respectively, sound and strongly complete with respect to the Kripkean local and global semantic consequence relations'
