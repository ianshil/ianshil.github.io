Currently, I am holding a Research Fellow position in the Theory Group of the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. My position is funded by the UKRI Fellowship StrIP led by Anupam Das. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australian National University in Canberra, where I did my PhD under the supervision of Rajeev Goré.

My research focuses on different aspects of computation. Much of my research is in relation to (constructive) type theory, often involving the proof assistant Coq. See below for a list of projects. I am excited about any potential collaborator for any of these topics, if you are interested in working with me please get in touch no matter your location, level of expertise, or academic experience – including no or little expertise or experience!
