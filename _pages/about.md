Currently, I am holding a __Research Fellow__ position in the Theory Group of the School of Computer Science at the __University of Birmingham__. My position is funded by the UKRI Fellowship __StrIP__ led by [Anupam Das](https://www.anupamdas.com). Previously, I was a __Postdoctoral Fellow__ at the __Australian National University__ in Canberra working with [Peter Höfner](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/peter-hoefner/). I also obtained my __PhD__, under the supervision of [Rajeev Goré](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=2lWIhEgAAAAJ&hl), at the __Australian National University__.

My research focuses on mathematical and computational aspects of logics. Much of my research consists in studying non-classical logics from a proof-theoretic angle, but I also venture myself down the semantic (Kripke, algebraic, topological, ...) path every now and then. I try my best to formalise all my results in the interactive theorem prover [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org).
